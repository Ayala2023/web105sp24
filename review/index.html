<p>Today I'm going to be reviewing on Battlefront 2's graphics, sound effects, story mode,
    and even charaters in the game; characters like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader,
    and etc.

<h2>Game Play and characters</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
<p>Battlefront 2's graphics are litteraly amazing. The quality of it looks real life and
    realistic, so you get to feel the real life experience of the game. The sound effcets of
    the game are trully amazing. The explosions of the AT-NT and walkers are super loud and
    realistic like the game. The story mode is really good, you get to play and see your favorite
    Star Wars hero and learned a little about their story and journey. The characters in the game
    are really cool, I like how you can choose different types of styles that characters in the Star
    Wars movie used. For example, you can select the costume of Anakin Skywalker with his cape or not.
